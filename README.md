Learning Urgences Factory	

Itâ€™s a WebApp whose purpose is to generate training certificates for participants after having followed the training. The participant will be able to give his opinion on the training and retrieve his certificate in his mailbox. The administrator has a back office, where he will be able to manage his training sessions, retrieve his opinions and archive its data.


Step 1:

The administrator adds a company and its data, he creates a session with the company, which will generate an access code (4 digits). He must then add the training data with the session he has just created. He must finally press the green "Register" button to activate access.

Step 2:

The participant enters the code provided to him and enters his information. Then he will give his opinion on the training and answer 3 questions. Following this, he will find his certificate in his mailbox with a thank email.

Step 3:

Once all participants have retrieved their attestation, the administrator can archive the "Archiver" session. This will send the company a thank you email along with the review and question data. The access code will no longer work and the participants giving will be hidden.
